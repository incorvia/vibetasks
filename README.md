# VibeTask

A Todoist-style task & project manager that lives **inside** Obsidian — with a fast, native UI on top of plain Markdown. Every task is a single Markdown note, so your data stays open, portable and future-proof, and there are **no plugin dependencies** and no account required.

## Why VibeTask

- **One note per task.** Each task is a normal Markdown file with YAML frontmatter. Nothing is locked in a proprietary database — search it, edit it by hand, sync it, or version it with Git.
- **A real task app, natively.** A Todoist-inspired dashboard with sidebar navigation, a chip-based task editor, quick capture and keyboard-friendly flows — all rendered inside Obsidian, popout-window compatible.
- **Zero plugin dependencies, local-first.** No other plugin and no account required. Your tasks are plain Markdown in your vault — the one optional online feature is two-way **Google Calendar sync**, which stays off until you set it up.
- **Your frontmatter stays yours.** VibeTask uses a documented mdbase schema and preserves additional properties it does not understand. Turning an existing note into a task adds canonical frontmatter and leaves its Markdown body alone.
- **Fully themeable.** Every color is a CSS variable; works with your theme, CSS snippets, or the Style Settings plugin — including a monochrome mode.
- **10 languages.** The interface is available in English, German, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazil), French, Italian, Turkish, Russian, Simplified Chinese and Japanese (auto-detected from Obsidian, or set in settings). Natural-language **dates and times** work in all of them except Turkish, where English keywords (`tomorrow`, `next monday`) still do. English keywords work in every language, alongside your own.

## Features

### Views & navigation
A single dashboard with a left sidebar:

- **Inbox** — everything without a project.
- **Today** — tasks due today (plus anything overdue).
- **Upcoming** — a forward-looking, date-sorted agenda.
- **Recurring** — all repeating tasks at a glance.
- **Done** — completed tasks, with a built-in **Trash** for soft-deleted items.
- **Projects, Areas, Labels & Filters** — collapsible sections in the sidebar; open any project, area, label or saved filter as a **list, Kanban board or calendar**.
- **Search** — fast fuzzy search across all tasks; jump straight to a task and highlight it in place.
- **Manage** — a ListManager with separate **Projects**, **Areas**, **Labels** and **Filters** tabs: create, rename, recolor, hide, archive or delete each, and restore or permanently remove trashed items.

Every sidebar entry has a **right-click menu** (go to its note, edit, recolor, convert, hide, reorder, archive, delete), and you can **reorder** sections by drag or sort them **manually, by name or by task count**.

**Projects vs. Areas.** Organize tasks into **projects** or **areas** — two independent kinds, each with its own tab in the ListManager and its own `+` in the sidebar, so you can **create, archive and delete either one directly**. An **Area** is a fixed section that keeps its own place in the sidebar — ideal for long-running responsibilities that should never be “finished” — while a **project** is for work that eventually wraps up. You can convert one into the other at any time.

### Saved filters & smart views
Build custom queries — by project/area, label, priority, status, date range and more — and **save them to the sidebar** as reusable smart views, each with its own color. Per-view display options (layout, grouping, sorting, show completed) are remembered.

If a saved filter points at something you later deleted — a label, a project, a custom status — VibeTask doesn't quietly return nothing. The affected dropdown is **outlined in red** and the entry is listed as *“… (missing)”*, so you can see the cause and remove it with one click.

### Three layouts: list, board or calendar

Every page — projects, areas, labels, saved filters, and Today / Upcoming / Inbox — can be shown in one of three ways. The choice is **remembered per page**, so a project can stay a board while Today stays a list.

**List** — the classic, with grouping (by date, deadline, priority, label, project or status), sorting, and optional completed tasks.

**Board** — a Kanban whose columns follow your **statuses** (fully customizable, see below):

- **Drag & drop** a card between columns to change its status instantly.
- **Group the board** by status, label, priority or project — not just status.
- **Reorder columns** by dragging their headers (saved per board), and add a task straight into a column with its `+`.
- Columns **stack vertically** on narrow panes and mobile, so the board stays usable on the phone.

**Calendar** — your tasks on a **year, month, week or day** grid, with a side panel for undated tasks. Drag a task onto a day to schedule it. In Today and Upcoming, your **Google events** can appear alongside them (read-only, see below).

Because columns map to the task's `status` field and days map to its date, moving a card or a task is just a normal edit to its Markdown note — nothing lives in a separate board file.

### Custom statuses
Define your own workflow beyond the built-in *To-Do · In progress · Done · Cancelled*. In *Settings → Statuses* you can **add, rename, reorder, recolor and change the icon** of statuses, grouped into three categories — **open · done · cancelled** — that drive behavior (completion timestamps, recurrence, trash). The in-progress state shows as a **half-filled checkbox** everywhere.

### Tasks & attributes
Each task can carry:

- **Status** — the built-in *To-Do · In progress · Done* (plus a *Cancelled* trash state), or your **own custom statuses**. Set one by **right-clicking** the checkbox (or **long-pressing** it on mobile), from the **status chip** in the task editor, or by dragging on the Kanban board — a left-click still simply completes the task.
- **Priority** (highest → lowest) with colored checkbox rings (P1/P2/P3).
- **Due date & time** and an optional **duration** (event length).
- A separate **deadline / scheduled** date & time. A task with only a deadline still shows up in Today and Upcoming when it comes due — one rule, no task hiding because you filled in the “wrong” date field. Deadlines are written as a countdown (*“in 3 days”*) and coloured by distance.
- **Project** and **Area** assignment.
- **Sub-tasks** — nest tasks under a parent, drawn with clean connector lines. Choose per view how they appear: compact (as progress on the parent), indented beneath it, or standing on their own.
- **Labels** (`#tags`).
- **Recurrence** — “every day / week / 3 months …”, repeating from either the **due date** or the **completion date**.
- **Reminders** — get notified before or at a task’s time (see below).
- A **Markdown description**, a **timestamped comment log**, and **file/image attachments** (see below).

### Quick capture with natural language
Add tasks at the speed of thought. The quick-add modal understands plain sentences:

> `Write report tomorrow p1 #work`
> `Bericht schreiben morgen um 07:30 #arbeit`
> `Escribir informe mañana #importante`

**Dates and times** are understood in your interface language — English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Russian, Chinese and Japanese. English keywords work everywhere, alongside your own, so `Escribir informe tomorrow` is fine too. Turkish has no date parser yet; there, English keywords are the way.

Everything else in the table below is the same in every language: **recurrence** is written in English or German (`every day`, `jeden Tag`), and `p1`, `#label` and `@project` are symbols, not words.

Recognized tokens are stripped from the title automatically:

| What | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| **Date** | `today`, `tomorrow`, `day after tomorrow`, `in 3 days`, `next week`, `next monday`, a bare weekday (`friday`), `3 Jul` / `July 3rd`, `20.06.2026`, `06/20/2026`, `2026-06-20` |
| **Time** | `at 7:30`, `7:30`, `7pm`, `at 7`, `um 20.15`, `um 2015` (four digits and the dot form need `at`/`um` in front — otherwise `Sort photos from 2015` would become a time) |
| **Recurrence** | `every day`, `daily`, `every week`, `weekly`, `every 3 days`, `every 2 weeks`, `every 3 months`, `yearly` |
| **Priority** | `p1`–`p4` or `!1`–`!4` |
| **Label** | `#work` — any label, created on the fly |
| **Project** | `@project` — existing projects and areas only |

A time or a recurrence without a date is anchored to **today**: a time needs a day to be shown and saved, and a recurrence without a date would never come back.

**Not recognized** (use the chips instead): reminders, duration, start date, status and parent.

#### When a word should stay text

Writing `Today's plan` and getting the word swallowed as a date is annoying. Two ways out — and both are the same thing under the hood:

- **Click the ✕ on the chip.** The recognized value goes away, the word returns to the title. This is the easy path; you don't need to know any syntax.
- **Type it yourself.** `\word` protects a single word — the same backslash escape Markdown uses, and the backslash disappears from the title. `"a whole phrase"` protects several words at once; the quotation marks stay, because they're your punctuation, not syntax.

```
\Today I go swimming      → title "Today I go swimming", no date
Book "Der Prozess" today  → title kept as typed, due today
every \monday standup     → title "every monday standup", no recurrence
```

The ✕ simply writes that backslash for you: `Dentist tomorrow` → ✕ → `Dentist \tomorrow`. Because the escape lives in the text, it survives — and typing a new date word afterwards is recognized again.

Prefer full control? Open the Todoist-style task editor with its chip row for date, priority, labels, recurrence, deadline, reminder and parent — and **show, hide or reorder those chips** to taste (separately for quick add and the full editor).

### Reminders
Attach one or more reminders to a task — either **relative** (“at time of task”, 10 min / 30 min / 1 h / 1 day before) or an **absolute** date & time. When a reminder is due, VibeTask shows a **system notification** on desktop (even when Obsidian is in the background) and an in-app notice; clicking it opens the task.

> **Good to know:** in-app reminders fire while Obsidian is running (on desktop that includes the background; on mobile while the app is open). To be notified even when Obsidian is **fully closed**, turn on **Google Calendar sync** — reminders are pushed onto the calendar event, so your phone or OS notifies you.

### Notes, comments & attachments
Every task has a **Details** panel for the story behind the task:

- A free-form **Markdown description**.
- A **timestamped comment log** to track progress over time — add, edit and revisit notes, each stamped with its date and time.
- **Attachments** — click the paperclip, or simply **paste or drag & drop** files and images straight into a comment. They’re saved to your configurable attachments folder, and images appear as thumbnails with a built-in **lightbox** (zoom, copy to clipboard).
- **Link other notes** into a comment to connect related context from your vault.

Because it all lives in the task note’s own Markdown body, your comments and attachments stay readable and portable outside the plugin, too.

### Right-click anything
Every task row — in lists, on the board and in the calendar — has a **context menu** with the things you reach for most: set a date or priority in one click, add a reminder, move it to another project, area or the inbox, jump to its parent task, duplicate it, copy a deep link, open the note in Obsidian, or send it to the trash.

### Drag & drop
Drag a task onto a **project, area or the inbox** in the sidebar to move it there, or onto a **label** to add that label. On the board, drag between columns; in the calendar, drag onto a day.

### Everyday conveniences
- **Recolor & organize** projects, areas, labels and filters — set a color, convert a project ↔ area, hide, reorder or archive, all from the right-click menu or the Manage screen.
- **Duplicate** a task, **copy a deep link** (`obsidian://`) to it, or **print** a clean copy.
- **Soft delete** to Trash, then restore or empty it — nothing is lost by accident (Trash and Done are ordered newest-first).
- **Export & import all tasks as JSON** — a lossless backup of your task data (fields and description) that you can restore or move to another vault. Import from within the vault or from a file on disk; re-importing is **idempotent** (existing tasks are matched by id and skipped), and missing projects, areas and labels are recreated. Attachments and the comment log stay as separate files in your vault (back them up with the folder).
- **Import from TaskNotes** — migrate tasks from the TaskNotes plugin (non-destructive, idempotent), or import existing checkboxes from the Tasks/Lists format.
- **Order by hand** — switch sorting to *Manual* and drag rows by their handle or cards on the board. The order is stored in the notes and holds in every view.
- **Icons-only chips** for a more compact editor, and an optional **description preview** under task titles in lists.
- Localized in **10 languages**, mobile-friendly, and **popout-window compatible**.

## Getting started

1. Install VibeTask and enable it.
2. Click the **check-circle** ribbon icon (or run **“Open VibeTask”**) to open the dashboard.
3. Hit **Add task** / run **Quick add**, type something like `Buy milk tomorrow #errands`, and press Enter.

That’s it — a new Markdown note is created for the task in your configured folder.

## How your data is stored

Every task is a Markdown note with frontmatter. Nothing proprietary:

```yaml
---
type: task
id: t-8f3a1
title: Write the launch blog post
status: todo            # todo | doing | done | cancelled
priority: high
due: 2026-07-10T09:00
scheduled: 2026-07-08
duration: 30            # minutes
project: "[[Website Relaunch]]"
parent: "[[Draft the outline]]"
labels: [work, writing]
recurrence: every week
recur_basis: due        # due | done
reminders: ["-30m", "2026-07-10T08:00"]
created: 2026-07-04
description: Free-form text shown under the title
---
```

The body is yours — VibeTask keeps its own notes (comments, attachments) in a collapsible
`###### VibeTask Details-Logbuch` section at the bottom and leaves everything above it alone.

### Where the title comes from

Tasks keep their title in `title:`. If a note doesn't have that field, VibeTask falls back,
in this order:

1. **`title:` in the frontmatter**
2. the **first level-1 heading** in the note
3. the **file name**

Renaming a task writes the new title back to wherever it came from, so the two never drift.
The file name is never changed — it is the note's identity, and links to projects and parent
tasks resolve through it.

That gives you one guarantee worth spelling out: **VibeTask only writes into the body of a
note that already has a title there — a level-1 heading as its first heading.** If your note
starts with `## Something`, or has no heading at all, the title is stored as `title:` in the
frontmatter instead and your text is left alone. Notes with a structure of their own keep it.

**Turning a note into a task never touches its text.** The command only adds frontmatter: the
fields that make it a task, plus `title:` — taken from the note's level-1 heading, or its file
name if there is none. Whatever you wrote in the body stays exactly as it is, heading included.
Add a description in the task dialog if you want one, and use **Open task note** from the task's
context menu to jump back to it.

Upgrading from an earlier version? A one-time pass moves existing titles from the heading into
`title:`. It removes that heading line only in notes VibeTask created itself — those live in
your tasks folder — and only when the line really was the title. Everything you wrote yourself
keeps its heading, and no task changes the title it displays.

### Local mdbase collection

On first run VibeTask initializes an isolated mdbase collection at `_vibetasks/`, with
`mdbase.yaml` and five JSON Schema type definitions under `_vibetasks/_types/`: `task`, `project`,
`area`, `filter`, and `template`. Notes elsewhere in the vault are not collection records, even
when they happen to use the same `type` value. Canonical fields (`type`, `id`, `title`, `created`, and `modified`) make the files predictable
for other local software, while every schema permits additional user properties.

Markdown remains authoritative. VibeTask validates its own writes, preserves manually introduced
invalid records and reports diagnostics instead of rewriting them. Statuses, priorities, and record
paths are defined in the type files; their corresponding settings edit those definitions.

The Obsidian plugin uses only mobile-safe Vault and metadata APIs. It does not ship the Node mdbase
library, SQLite, mdbase Connect, a hosted mirror, or a dependency on another Obsidian plugin.

### Project notes

Projects, areas and saved filters are Markdown notes too — and **their body belongs to you**. VibeTask stores what it needs in the frontmatter and writes nothing into the text, so the note is a natural place for everything that belongs to that project: a brief, links, meeting notes, images.

Reach it from the **context menu** of the sidebar entry, or from the **⋯ menu** on the project page → **Open project note** (or area / filter note). It is worth opening: because every task points at it with `project: "[[Name]]"`, that note is already where Obsidian's backlinks and graph converge.

A **description** in the frontmatter is shown above the task list (switch it off under Settings → *Show description on project pages*) — the one-line answer to “what is this for”. Set it in the project's edit dialog; the long version goes in the body.

```yaml
---
type: project
id: 01K4D9HQ2B32F6B8QKM4E9N6J5
title: September launch
created: 2026-09-05T12:00:00Z
modified: 2026-09-05T12:00:00Z
status: active
description: Everything for the September launch
color: "#4caf50"
---

Your own notes start right here.
```

The name comes from the required `title` field. Renaming a project, area, filter, or template updates both its title and filename, and Obsidian plus VibeTask update links pointing at it.

By default, notes live under these folders (all configurable in settings):

| Content | Default folder |
| --- | --- |
| Collection root | `_vibetasks` |
| Tasks | `_vibetasks/tasks` |
| Projects & Areas | `_vibetasks/projects` |
| Saved filters | `_vibetasks/filters` |
| Templates | `_vibetasks/templates` |
| Attachments | `_vibetasks/attachments` |
| mdbase type definitions | `_vibetasks/_types` |

Projects and areas are the same kind of note (`type: project` / `type: area`), so they share one folder.

To associate an existing vault note without turning it into a database record, focus the note and run
**VibeTask: Create linked project from current note**. VibeTask silently creates the canonical record
under `_vibetasks/projects/`, stores a `linked_note` wikilink on that record, and appends a live
`vibetask` project embed to the original note. The embed refers to the stable project ID, so renaming
either file does not disconnect the view. Running the command again reuses the linked project instead
of creating a duplicate. The project menu also offers **Open project record** and **Open linked note**.

Projects and areas created inside VibeTask have the reverse action in their page overflow menu. **Create
linked note** creates a regular companion note in Obsidian's configured new-note location, inserts the
live list embed, and links it to the collection record. Once linked, the menu opens that note instead. An
assigned project's page can also be opened directly from the task editor, beside the project picker.

## Google Calendar sync

VibeTask can mirror every task that has a **due date** into Google Calendar, two-way: the **date and time** flow in both directions, while everything else (title, duration, reminders) is driven by Obsidian. It uses **your own** Google API credentials — no third-party server is involved, and your token stays in your vault.

### Setup (one-time, ~5 min)

1. **Project** — open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and create or pick a project.
2. **Enable the API** — go to *APIs & Services → Library*, search for **Google Calendar API**, and click **Enable**.
3. **Consent screen** — open *Google Auth Platform → Get started*: set an app name and your email, and choose **Audience = External**. Then open **Audience** and **Publish app** so the status is **In production**.
   > ⚠️ **Important:** In *Testing* mode, refresh tokens for calendar scopes expire after **7 days**, so the sync would break every week. *In production* they stay valid. You do **not** need Google to verify the app while you are the only user.
4. **Create the client** — go to *Clients → Create client*, set Application type to **Desktop app**, click **Create**, then copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret**.
5. **Connect** — in Obsidian open *Settings → VibeTask → Google Calendar*, paste the Client ID and secret, and click **Connect**. On the “Google hasn’t verified this app” screen choose **Advanced → Continue** — this is expected for a personal app.
6. **Calendar** — VibeTask creates and selects a dedicated **“VibeTask”** calendar (small blast radius; your other calendars are never touched). Done.

The required permissions (`calendar.events`, `calendar.readonly`, `calendar.app.created`) are requested when you connect — there is nothing to pre-register in the consent screen. On **mobile**, step 5 uses a device-code login (you enter a short code on another device) instead of the desktop loopback flow.

### What syncs

| Field | Obsidian → Google | Google → Obsidian |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Title | ✅ | — (Obsidian wins) |
| Date / time (`due`) | ✅ | ✅ written back |
| Duration | ✅ | — |
| Reminders | ✅ (as popups) | — |

- On a conflict (both sides changed the date), **Obsidian wins**.
- Existence is Obsidian-driven: an event deleted in Google is recreated as long as the task still has a date. To remove it for good, change the task in Obsidian or exclude its list.
- Exclude a project/area from sync via its right-click menu, the icon in the management list, or the edit dialog.

### Show your Google events

Separate from the sync, and read-only: switch on **Show events in VibeTask** and your Google appointments appear in **Today** and **Upcoming**, next to the tasks due that day. Pick which calendars to show, hide events you declined, and set the text size. Nothing is written back and no note is created — an event never becomes a task.

Project, label and filter pages deliberately stay free of them: those are about your own work, not your day's appointments.

### Where credentials live

Your Client ID/secret and the OAuth token are stored locally in `.obsidian/plugins/vibetask/data.json` (git-ignored). **Disconnect** in settings revokes the token with Google and deletes it locally. If you sync your vault by other means (Obsidian Sync, Dropbox, iCloud…), this file travels with it.

## On your phone

VibeTask itself runs on Obsidian mobile — the views, the editor and quick capture all work there. What a plugin *cannot* do on iOS or Android is put a widget on your home screen or notify you while Obsidian is closed. That is an operating-system boundary, not something a plugin can work around: reminders only fire while Obsidian is open and in the foreground.

For notifications while Obsidian is closed, turn on Google Calendar sync above. Dated tasks become
calendar events and the phone's calendar app can notify you with the screen off.

An independent task application can also consume the same mdbase collection when it has direct
filesystem access to the vault. No compatibility with TaskNotes or any particular third-party task
lifecycle is claimed. Obsidian Sync remains private Obsidian-to-Obsidian synchronization; VibeTask
does not route it through mdbase Connect or another cloud service.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Open VibeTask | Open the dashboard |
| Open Today / Upcoming / Recurring / Done | Jump straight to a view |
| New task | Open the full task editor |
| Quick add task | Fast natural-language capture |
| Turn current note into a task | Make the open note a task — adds frontmatter only, never touches your text |
| Search tasks | Fuzzy search |
| Count tasks | Show total / open count |
| Export tasks (JSON) | Save all tasks to a JSON file in your vault |
| Import tasks (JSON) | Restore tasks from a JSON export |
| Import from TaskNotes | Migrate tasks from the TaskNotes plugin |
| Import from Tasks/Lists | Migrate existing checkbox tasks |
| Sync with Google Calendar now | Run a calendar sync on demand |
| Show what’s new | Open the release highlights |
| Move titles to the frontmatter | Re-run the one-time title conversion (safe to repeat) |

Assign hotkeys to any of these under **Settings → Hotkeys**.

## Settings

- **Folders** for tasks, projects, filters and attachments — plus **excluded folders**, whose notes are never treated as tasks.
- **Field names** — which frontmatter fields VibeTask uses for `type` and `title` (see above).
- **Language** — auto (follow Obsidian) or pick one of 10 languages (English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Turkish, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Japanese).
- **Start view** — which view opens by default (or the last used one).

- **Task actions (chips)** — show, hide and reorder the attribute chips, separately for quick add and the full editor.
- **Statuses** — add, rename, reorder, recolor and re-icon your workflow statuses.
- **Colors** — a muted or a colorful meta style, or set every accent yourself.
- **Text size** — scale task text, sidebar entries and headings independently.
- **Icons-only chips**, **description preview in lists**, and the **description on project pages**.
- **Google Calendar** — connect your account, choose the target calendar and sync options (see above).
- **Import & Export** — JSON backup/restore, plus import from TaskNotes or the Tasks/Lists format.

## Theming

VibeTask is fully themeable through CSS custom properties. It ships with a built-in color palette (separate values for dark and light mode, defined on `.theme-dark` / `.theme-light`). Everything is overridable, so you can adapt it to any theme.

### 1. Style Settings plugin (color pickers, no CSS)

If you have the community plugin **Style Settings** installed, open its tab and you’ll find a **VibeTask → Colors** section with color pickers for the semantic colors (overdue, due today, recurring, labels, priorities). These also drive the icon colors. Nothing is required in VibeTask itself — without Style Settings the defaults simply apply. A **Monochrome (no colors)** toggle at the top renders everything in the text color and overrides the pickers.

### 2. A CSS snippet (full control)

Create a snippet under *Settings → Appearance → CSS snippets* and override any of the variables:

```css
body {
  --bt-overdue: #e05c4a;        /* overdue tasks & priority-1 ring */
  --bt-add:     #e05c4a;        /* the "+" of Add task / project / subtask */
  --bt-today:   #f97316;        /* tasks due today (also the Today sidebar icon) */
  --bt-recur:   #ec4899;        /* recurring (also the Recurring sidebar icon) */
  --bt-label:   #a855f7;        /* labels (also the Labels sidebar icon) */
  --bt-prio-1:  #ef4444;        /* priority 1 (highest) checkbox ring */
  --bt-prio-2:  #f59e0b;        /* priority 2 (high) */
  --bt-prio-3:  #3b82f6;        /* priority 3 (medium) */
  --bt-sched:   var(--text-muted);   /* deadline / scheduled chip */
  --bt-line:        rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.10);  /* section dividers */
  --bt-line-faint:  rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05);  /* task-row dividers */
}
```

Colors deliberately live in CSS variables (not in the plugin’s own settings) so themes, snippets and Style Settings can all drive them.

**Left sidebar icon colors** are themeable too. Each board has its own variable — `--bt-nav-search`, `--bt-nav-inbox`, `--bt-nav-heute`, `--bt-nav-demnaechst`, `--bt-nav-wiederkehrend`, `--bt-nav-erledigt`, `--bt-nav-manage` — and the item groups share one each: `--bt-nav-label`, `--bt-nav-area`, `--bt-nav-project`. For consistency, icons that also have a task chip default to the chip color (e.g. `--bt-nav-heute` → `--bt-today`).

### Per-project / per-area icon color

Individual projects, areas, labels and filters can have their own color. Pick one from the **color dot** in *Manage*, or from the **edit dialog** (right-click a sidebar entry → *Edit*). For projects and areas you can also set a `color:` property directly in the note’s frontmatter, e.g. `color: "#4caf50"`.

## Roadmap

VibeTask is under active development. This one is **planned and not yet available** — listed here so you know where it's headed:

- **Task & project templates** — reusable structures with relative dates (“three days after the start”), so a recurring set-up is one click instead of ten.

Recently shipped: **calendar layout** (year / month / week / day), **configurable field names**, **titles in the frontmatter**, **read-only Google events**, **drag & drop onto projects and labels**, and a **context menu on every task row**.

Have an idea or a request? Open an issue — feedback shapes the priorities.
